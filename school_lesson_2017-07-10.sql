	(40,'Social and emotional skills are critical to being a good student, citizen and worker; and many risky behaviors (e.g., drug use, violence, bullying and dropping out) can be prevented or reduced when multiyear, integrated efforts are used to develop students\' social and emotional skills. This is best done through effective classroom instruction; student engagement in positive activities in and out of the classroom; and broad parent and community involvement in program planning, implementation and evaluation.\n\nAnimation can teach SEL skills to students ages 4 to 8.  Animation is one of the world’s most powerful tools for communication. By using animation, it is possible to create stories that show characters exhibiting the inappropriate behavior we want to correct. Then, by using care and patience, the characters in the story can correct the inappropriate behavior and demonstrate to students the appropriate way to behave.  This allows students to witness a contrast between right and wrong. By modeling the appropriate behavior and rewarding the animated characters, it is possible to model and reinforce that same behavior in students.'),

In our work to end online and offline bullying, we learned that prevention is the key. When we take the third party witnesses of bullying episodes, whether in the classroom or on social media, and help them to understand the vital role they play in the bullying dynamic, bystanders naturally become Upstanders.
